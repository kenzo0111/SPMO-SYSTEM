# User Login Logging Feature

## Overview
The SPMO System now includes comprehensive user login activity logging. Every time a user successfully logs in through the Access System, their login activity is automatically recorded and displayed in the Admin Dashboard's User Management section.

## Features

### üìä What Gets Logged
Each login activity record includes:
- **Log ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., LOG001, LOG002)
- **Email**: User's email address
- **Name**: User's full name (extracted from email)
- **Action**: Type of activity (Login)
- **Timestamp**: Exact date and time of login (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
- **Device**: Device type (Windows PC, MacBook, Linux PC, Android, iOS)
- **IP Address**: IP address (placeholder for production implementation)
- **Status**: Success or Failed

### üîç Where to View Logs
1. Open the Admin Dashboard
2. Navigate to **User Management** from the sidebar
3. Scroll down to see **"User Login Activity Logs"** section
4. View all recent login activities in a detailed table

### üíæ Data Storage
- Logs are stored in `localStorage` with key: `spmo_userLogs`
- Automatically loads on dashboard initialization
- Keeps the most recent 100 login records
- Data persists across browser sessions

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

#### 1. **AccessSystem.html**
- Added `logUserLogin()` function to capture login events
- Automatically logs when user confirms login
- Extracts user information from email
- Detects device type from browser user agent

#### 2. **dashboard.js**
- Added `userLogs` array to MockData
- Created `logUserLogin()` function (dashboard version)
- Created `loadUserLogs()` function to restore logs from localStorage
- Updated `generateUsersManagementPage()` to display logs table
- Auto-loads logs on page initialization

### Data Structure

```javascript
{
  id: 'LOG001',
  email: 'user@cnsc.edu.ph',
  name: 'User Name',
  action: 'Login',
  timestamp: '2025-01-15 08:30:15',
  ipAddress: 'N/A',
  device: 'Windows PC',
  status: 'Success'
}
```

## How It Works

### Login Flow
1. User enters email and PIN on AccessSystem.html
2. User clicks "Continue" in confirmation dialog
3. `logUserLogin(email)` function is called
4. Log entry is created with:
   - Auto-generated log ID
   - Current timestamp
   - Device detection
   - User information
5. Entry is saved to localStorage
6. User is redirected to dashboard
7. Dashboard loads and displays all logs in User Management

### Device Detection
The system automatically detects:
- ‚úÖ Windows PC
- ‚úÖ MacBook (macOS)
- ‚úÖ Linux PC
- ‚úÖ Android Device
- ‚úÖ iOS Device (iPhone/iPad)
- ‚ùì Unknown Device (fallback)

## Usage Examples

### Viewing Logs
Navigate to **User Management** page to see:
- Complete table of all login activities
- Newest logins appear first
- Color-coded status badges (green for success, red for failed)
- Device icons and information
- Sortable columns

### Sample Log Entries
```
Timestamp            User               Email                    Device        Status
2025-01-15 10:20:33  Cherry Ann Quila   cherry@cnsc.edu.ph      Windows PC    Success
2025-01-15 09:15:42  Vince Balce        vince@cnsc.edu.ph       MacBook       Success
2025-01-15 08:30:15  Marinel Ledesma    marinel@cnsc.edu.ph     Windows PC    Success
```

## Benefits

### For Administrators
- üìà Monitor user access patterns
- üîí Enhanced security tracking
- üë• Identify active users
- üïê Track login times
- üì± See device usage statistics

### For Security

- Device fingerprinting

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Failed Login Tracking**: Log unsuccessful login attempts
2. **IP Address Detection**: Capture real IP addresses (server-side)
3. **Geolocation**: Show login location based on IP
4. **Export Logs**: Download logs as CSV/Excel
5. **Search & Filter**: Filter logs by user, date, device
6. **Login Alerts**: Email notifications for new logins
7. **Session Duration**: Track how long users are logged in
8. **Logout Tracking**: Log when users sign out

## Technical Notes

### LocalStorage Management
- Key: `spmo_userLogs`
- Format: JSON array
- Max entries: 100 (auto-pruned)
- Size limit: ~5MB (browser dependent)

### Performance
- Lightweight logging (~1ms per log)
- Async storage operations
- No impact on login speed
- Efficient data structure

### Browser Compatibility
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- ‚úÖ Firefox
- ‚úÖ Safari
- ‚úÖ Mobile browsers
- Requires localStorage support

## Troubleshooting

### Logs Not Appearing?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify localStorage is enabled
3. Clear browser cache and retry
4. Check if `spmo_userLogs` exists in localStorage

### Console Commands
```javascript
// View all logs
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('spmo_userLogs'))

// Clear all logs
localStorage.removeItem('spmo_userLogs')

// Count total logs
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('spmo_userLogs')).length
```

## Summary
The User Login Logging feature provides comprehensive activity tracking for the SPMO System. It automatically records every successful login with detailed information including timestamp, device type, and user details. All logs are displayed in an organized table within the User Management page, providing administrators with valuable insights into system usage and security.
